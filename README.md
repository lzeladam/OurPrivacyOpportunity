**The problem**

The most important pillar of a society is the family, it is the first community to which we are exposed, here we develop the first interpersonal relationships, values and transmits the sense of security that will help us grow as a person. However, no one is academically prepared to play the role of father or mother, we all learn to be parents in the process, others resort to schools, books, forums, and the experience of close friends.

Today's parents consume social networks that only show pictures of perfect families and moments. We all know that those pictures do not convey to reality, but for some reason, many parents compare their day-to-day lives with those perfect Instagram moments that only generate frustration, insecurity, and diminished self-esteem because they begin to believe they are not meeting the standard. On the other hand, when we ask friends or family we only get the information they feel they should tell, many times they omit the whole context because they fear being judged, harassed, rejected, or simply do not want to expose private and sensitive information. Finally, there are applications and forums on the Internet which are also unreliable sources and can include fake profiles.

It is also important to consider that there are a variety of families, such as traditional, single-parent, and same-sex parent families. If we manage to solve the problems of security, privacy, and veracity of sensitive data, we would enter an era of transparency, in which members of the community will expose various events that have occurred in their home and ask others about similar experiences, thus generating infinite benefits to society.

**Value Proposition**

Throughout history, not only the family model and its structure have changed, from the traditional nuclear family with couples of different genders to the same-sex family with couples of the same gender, but also how traditions are shared among its members. Today when we want to find out about parenting methods, feeding styles, treatments to typical diseases in children, etc., it is enough to surf the Internet to get an answer; however, you have to clean up all the noise and then ensure the veracity of the information in various sources. On the other hand, if you would like to share your experience on the Internet, you limit yourself when expressing your opinion in detail fearing others will judge you or your digital reputation will be harmed.

Social Paternity is a platform where parents can share their daily experiences, doubts, and exchange opinions with other parents who have the same concerns, as well as obtain general or detailed statistics that will help the decision-making when raising children, reinforce teaching methodology and support the research of health professionals.

To register in Social Paternity the user has to attach the necessary documentation or biometric information to support their identity, at all times the data will be encrypted even when making statistical reports, the platform will be decentralized to avoid manipulation of the data and thus the contribution of each member of the community will be valued democratically.

The individual can choose to show their data or remain anonymous in their community profile, thus ensuring freedom of expression.


**Use Cases / Audience**


*Traditional Parenting*

A woman is excited because she just found out that she is becoming a mother for the first time, but she is also worried no one in her circle of friends has recently become a mother. She would like to have contact with people who have recently gone through this stage. While surfing the Internet she learns about this application that will help her connect with real mothers who have just gone through this stage and want to share their experience.


*Same-sex Parents*

A couple has decided to take on the role of parents and is looking for statistics on cities with the highest rate of same-sex parent families and adoption counsellors. While surfing the Internet, they find a community where they can express their ideas without being judged or harassed, and immediately subscribe to Social Paternity.

*Schools and Teachers*

Early childhood, elementary and high school teachers have learned that there is an online community where parents are sharing opinions and impressions about the quality of teaching in their neighbourhood schools. Also, the best schools are recommended among the users of the application according to their preferences; so teachers create an account to know which pedagogical aspects to improve.
